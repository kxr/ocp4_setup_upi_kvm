## Adding Nodes

Once the installation is successful, you will find a `add_node.sh` script in the `--setup-dir` (default: /root/ocp4\_setup\_{CLUSTER_NAME}). You can use this to add more nodes to the cluster, post installation.

### Usage:
    cd [setup-dir]
    ./add_node.sh --name [node-name] [OPTIONS]

| Option  |Description   |
| :------------ | :------------ |
|______________________________||
| --name NAME | The node name without the domain.<br> For example: If you specify storage-1, and your cluster name is "ocp4" and base domain is "local", the new node would be "storage-1.ocp4.local".<br> Default: [not set] [REQUIRED] |
| -c, --cpu N | Number of CPUs to be attached to this node's VM. Default: 2|
| -m, --memory SIZE(MB) | Amount of Memory to be attached to this node's VM. Size in MB.<br> Default: 4096 |
| -a, --add-disk SIZE(GB) | You can add additional disks to this node. Size in GB.<br> This option can be specified multiple times. Disks are added in order for example if you specify "--add-disk 10 --add-disk 100", two disks will be added (on top of the OS disk vda) first of 10GB (/dev/vdb) and second disk of 100GB (/dev/vdc).<br> Default: [not set] |
| -v, --vm-dir | The location where you want to store the VM Disks.<br> By default the location used by the cluster VMs will be used. |
|  -N, --libvirt-oct OCTET| You can specify a 192.168.{OCTET}.0 subnet octet and this script will create a new libvirt network for this node.<br> The network will be named ocp-{OCTET}. If the libvirt network ocp-{OCTET} already exists, it will be used.<br> This can be useful if you want to add a node in different network than the one used by the cluster.<br> Default: [not set] |
| -n, --libvirt-network NETWORK | The libvirt network to use. Select this option if you want to use an existing libvirt network.<br> By default the existing libvirt network used by the cluster will be used. |

## Exposing the cluster outside the host/hypervisor
Once the installation is successful, you will find a `expose_cluster.sh` script in the `--setup-dir` (default: /root/ocp4\_setup\_{CLUSTER_NAME}). You can use this to expose this cluster so it can be accessed from outside.

### Usage:

    cd [setup-dir]
    ./expose_cluster.sh --method [ firewalld | haproxy ]

If you are running a single cluster on your bare metal machine, you can expose that cluster via firewalld method (port forwarding). If you want to host and access multiple clusters, you can use the haproxy method.

### DNS (External)

Once you have exposed your cluster(s), you must ensure you have the proper DNS entries available to your external clients. One simple way to do this is to edit the `/etc/hosts` file on your client machines such that your exposed cluster endpoints are declared. The output of the `.expose_cluster.sh` script will give you an example line you can use for your `/etc/hosts` file.

You need to expose a minimum of three endpoints: the OpenShift console, the API endpoint, and the OAuth endpoint. For example, if you installed with the default names (i.e. the cluster name is "ocp4" and the base domain is "local") you will need to expose these three endpoints:

* console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.local
* api.ocp4.local
* oauth-openshift.apps.ocp4.local

If you will later configure OpenShift to expose its image registry (a typical dev use case that will allow you to push images directly into your cluster), you will need to expose this endpoint as well:

* default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.ocp4.local

Finally, any custom Route resources you create in your OpenShift cluster will also need to be exposed via DNS.

### haproxy

If you are exposing your cluster using haproxy and SELinux is in Enforcing mode (on the hypervisor), you need to tell it to treat port 6443 as a webport via `semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 6443`. Otherwise, SELinux will not let haproxy listen on port `6443`

Similarly is firewalld is enabled, you need to open up the necessary ports via:

```
firewall-cmd --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --add-service=https
firewall-cmd --add-port=6443/tcp
```

The output of the `expose_cluster.sh --method haproxy` script will remind you about these additional configurations.

___

## Auto Starting VMs

By default, if you reboot the host/hypervisor, the VMs will not start up automatically. You can set `--autostart-vms` when running the install script that will mark the VMs to auto-start. To see which VMs are set or not set to auto-start you can run `virsh list --all --name --autostart` or `virsh list --all --name --no-autostart` respectively.

If you want to change/set the autostart behaviour, you can set the VMs to auto-start by running:

~~~
for vm in $(virsh list --all --name --no-autostart | grep "<CLUSTER-NAME>"); do
  virsh autostart ${vm}
done
~~~

Similarly, to disable the auto starting of VMs, you can run:

~~~
for vm in $(virsh list --all --name --autostart | grep "<CLUSTER-NAME>"); do
  virsh autostart --disable ${vm}
done
~~~

Note: Replace `<CLUSTER-NAME>` with the cluster name or any matching string to filter out VMs that you want to set/un-set to be auto-started.

## Errors While Waiting for clusterversion

When the bootstrap process is complete, the script waits for clusterversion to become ready before the cluster installation is considered completed. During this phase the script just shows the status/message of the the clustervresion operator. You can see different kind of errors which are normal. This is due to the nature of operator reconciliation process. For example:

~~~
====> Waiting for clusterversion:
--> Unable to apply 4.5.0-rc.6: an unknown error has occurred: MultipleErr ...
--> Unable to apply 4.5.0-rc.6: an unknown error has occurred: MultipleErr ...
--> Working towards 4.5.0-rc.6: 62% complete
--> Working towards 4.5.0-rc.6: 62% complete
--> Unable to apply 4.5.0-rc.6: an unknown error has occurred: MultipleErr ...
--> Working towards 4.5.0-rc.6: 99% complete
~~~

~~~
====> Waiting for clusterversion:
  --> Working towards 4.3.12: 46% complete
  --> Unable to apply 4.3.12: an unknown error has occurred
  --> Working towards 4.3.12: 61% complete
  --> Unable to apply 4.3.12: an unknown error has occurred
  --> Unable to apply 4.3.12: an unknown error has occurred
  --> Unable to apply 4.3.12: an unknown error has occurred
~~~

Just let it run and hopefully the clusterversion operator will reconcile and become ready eventually.
